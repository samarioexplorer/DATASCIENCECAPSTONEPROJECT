Capstone Project – Optimal location for a Colombian restaurant in Madrid

Introduction
Madrid is the capital and most populous city of Spain. The city has almost 3.3 million inhabitants
and a metropolitan area population of approximately 6.5 million. It is the second-largest city in
the European Union (EU), surpassed only by Berlin, and its monocentric metropolitan area is
the second-largest in the EU, surpassed only by Paris. The municipality covers 604.3 km2
.
As the capital city of Spain, the city has attracted many immigrants from around the world, with
most of the immigrants coming from Latin American countries. In 2020, around 76 % of the
registered population was Spain-born, while, regarding the foreign-born population (24 %), the
bulk of it relates to the Americas (around 16 % of the total population), and a lesser fraction of
the population is born in other European, Asian and African countries. With its diverse culture,
comes diverse food items. There are many restaurants in Madrid, each belonging to different
categories like Spanish, Argentinian, Peruvian, Ecuadorian, Chinese.

Problem description
The main task is to find the best possible location or the most optimal, for a Colombian restaurant
in Madrid. To accomplish this task, an analytical approach will be used, based on advanced
Machine Learning techniques and Data Analysis, mainly Clustering and some Data Visualization
techniques. During the process of analysis, several data transformations will be performed to find
the best possible data format for the Machine Learning model. Once the data is set up and
prepared, a modeling process will be carried out, and this statistical analysis will provide the best
possible places to locate the Colombian restaurant.

Data Presentation
The data that will be used to develop this project is based on two sites:
• The Foursquare API, this data will be accessed via Python, and used to obtain the most
common venues per neighborhood in the city of Madrid. It is possible to have a taste of how
the city's venues are distributed, what the most common places are for leisure, and for the
most part, it will provide an idea about the preferences of the inhabitants.
• The Madrid City Hall's Web Portal, this site provides several data sources of great utility to
solve this problem. The files are provided in Excel format and are built over a statistical
exploitation. The data contains updated information about the immigrant population per
nationality. This data will be analyzed in such a way that one could determine the best location
of a new venue/restaurant/other based on nationality. For make things simpler, it will be
assumed for this exercise that people preferences vary according to their nationality, and
people from one specific country will be more attracted to place that matches the
environment and culture of their own countries, rather than the ones from foreign countries.
